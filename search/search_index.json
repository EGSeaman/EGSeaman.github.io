I aimed for a minimalist design and a structure that would defy gravity.  The table rests on the sill of a window, turning an outdoor space into a functional surface. To achieve the simplicity, I used a carpenter\u2019s joinery techniques like lapped and dowel joints. The dowel joint makes the leg detachable, making the table portable and easily stored.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"OCP/#black-and-white","title":"Black and White","text":"<p>This is a sampling of pieces I created in white and black cardstock for a class in 2D art.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Portfolio/","title":"Digital Media Portfolio","text":""},{"location":"Portfolio/#movie-theater-app","title":"Movie Theater App","text":"<p>I created this portfolio as a part of Google\u2019s seven-course series in UX/UI design on Coursera.

I am particularly drawn to how these ancient forms use negative space\u2014not just as emptiness, but as something that gives meaning and definition to what surrounds it. This interplay creates a quiet tension that I find both powerful and reflective. My artistic process begins with hand-drawn sketches of Ancient Greek buildings, where I focus on the precision, symmetry, and balance that define classical architecture. After completing these sketches, I digitize and layer them using Adobe Photoshop, treating each layer as a frame in a larger sequence. Through this technique, I\u2019m able to create an animation that eventually reveals each structure. The slow movement allows the viewer to engage with the form over time, experiencing the architecture as something dynamic rather than static. Ultimately, my work aims to highlight the emotional and aesthetic resonance of architectural space. By emphasizing both what is shown and what is withheld, I hope to invite viewers to reflect on the role of absence in shaping meaning\u2014and to consider how even the spaces in between can carry weight.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Portfolio/#rotoscope-animations","title":"Rotoscope Animations","text":""},{"location":"Portfolio/#website-design","title":"Website Design","text":""}]}

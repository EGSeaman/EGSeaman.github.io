I created this portfolio as a part of Googleâ€™s seven-course series in UX/UI design on Coursera.  The portfolio illustrates not only my design of an e-commerce app using Figma, but also the steps in my design process, from ideation and building wireframes to prototyping, UX research, and concept testing.

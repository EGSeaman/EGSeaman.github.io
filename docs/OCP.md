## **Lap and Dowel**

For a project in a sculpture course at Colby, I wanted to make something both useful and creative:  a new twist on a wooden table.  I aimed for a minimalist design and a structure that would defy gravity.  The table rests on the sill of a window, turning an outdoor space into a functional surface. To achieve the simplicity, I used a carpenterâ€™s joinery techniques like lapped and dowel joints. The dowel joint makes the leg detachable, making the table portable and easily stored.
